### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After nine months of exciting training at Datacientest.com, I am enthusiastic about the idea of being able to apply my new skills to problems of all kinds, especially industrial ones.
Signal analysis and processing skills, machine learning and deep learning aptness developped during training can have a direct application in  acoustic monitoring of industrial equipments, production trend forecast and quality control.

As a former managing partner and now freelance engineer, I also have a definite interest in finance and always looking for optimization. My recent programming abilities will certainly be of a grand help in my quest of efficiency.
